In the quiet village of Rivenhollow, nestled between forgotten hills and the edge of the Whispering Woods, young Elric stumbled upon an ancient map hidden beneath a loose stone in his cottage. The parchment was fragile, its edges burnt and curling, but the symbols glowed faintly under moonlight. The map led deep into the woods, where no villager dared venture for generations. Elric, curious and bold, couldn't resist. With the map clutched tightly in hand, he stepped beyond the village’s safety, unaware that this journey would awaken secrets that slept for centuries.

Elara traced the faded lines of the map with a trembling finger, her heart quickening with every step it promised beyond the village borders. The inked symbols—some resembling ancient trees, others unfamiliar glyphs—whispered secrets she had only dreamed of uncovering. Despite the chill of the evening air, a warmth blossomed inside her, fueled by a restless curiosity that no warning could quell.

After a moment's hesitation, she folded the map carefully and slipped it into her satchel. The forest at the edge of town, long a place of whispered tales and shadowy warnings, now beckoned like an uncharted promise. Determined, Elara adjusted her cloak, took a deep breath, and stepped into the fading light, each footfall a quiet vow to follow the map’s call wherever it might lead.

Elara took a quiet step into the Whispering Woods. The sunlight peeked through the tall trees, making shiny spots on the ground. She could hear leaves whispering and birds singing far away. Elara felt a little scared but also excited, because this was her first time in the forest alone.

The wind seemed to carry a soft murmur, as if the trees themselves were watching and waiting.
