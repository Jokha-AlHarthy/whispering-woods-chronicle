Villain concept: a shadowy sorcerer who feeds on forgotten memories.

Clue for Elara: she finds a scorched piece of parchment with half an ancient rune.

(This rune might be linked to the Sorcererâ€™s memory magic.)

Silly idea for Chronomancer's Cipher: Elara meets a time-traveling squirrel named Squeaky.

Another clue idea: a torn map leading into the haunted grove.
